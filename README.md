This automation project was developed with the aim of streaming the video editing 
and uploading process to two platforms(Instagram (reels) and Tiktok, making it a 
seamless and hassle-free experience. By selecting a video for upload, the user 
can trigger an automated editing process that cleverly incorporates Reddit posts 
of their choice and captivating parkour footage or any video of their preference. 
All these features are accessible through a user-friendly console interface, making 
it an exciting first version of our project.
